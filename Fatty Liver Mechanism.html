    <h2>Effects of Overfeeding on the Liver in Shitou Geese </h2>
	</p>
	
		The livers of Shitou geese in the treatment group, which was overfed brown rice for 24 hours, were significantly larger and lighter in color compared to the control group, with the liver weight being 3.5 times heavier and the liver index 3.14 times higher. Histological analysis revealed increased glycogen content and extensive fat infiltration in the treatment group, along with cellular vacuolation and nuclear compression, indicating the development of fatty liver due to lipid accumulation.

    <h2>Effects of Overfeeding on Biochemical Indices in the Livers of Shitou Geese </h2>
		</p>
	
		Biochemical analysis of the livers from control and overfed Shitou geese revealed no significant differences in ALT and AST activities or their ratio, suggesting no severe liver damage from 24 hours of overfeeding. However, there was a significant increase in total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglycerides (TG), and glycogen levels in the overfed group, indicating altered lipid and glucose metabolism with elevated blood lipid levels and enhanced liver glycogen synthesis.

A total of 891 upregulated and 619 downregulated genes were identified in the livers of overfed Shitou geese, which are likely key regulators in fatty liver formation. These genes were enriched in biological processes and pathways related to lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, and cellular signaling, including glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, and the insulin signaling pathway.

		A total of 1,559 SDMs were identified in the livers of overfed Shitou geese, with 576 upregulated and 983 downregulated. Heatmaps and correlation analysis showed distinct patterns among these lipids, indicating their roles in fatty liver formation. Pathway enrichment analysis highlighted significant involvement in lipid metabolism and related processes, reflecting the impact of overfeeding on liver lipid accumulation and metabolism.

    <h2>Integrated Analysis of Transcriptomics and Lipidomics in Overfed Shitou Goose Liver </h2>
	</p>
	Combined analysis of DEGs and SDMs in Shitou geese livers after 24 hours of overfeeding revealed that glycerolipid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis were significantly enriched. These pathways are linked to fat synthesis, metabolism, and regulation, and their disruption due to overfeeding may lead to fatty liver formation. qRT-PCR validation of DEGs confirmed the reliability of the RNA-seq data. A regulatory network was constructed, highlighting their potential role in triglyceride synthesis and accumulation, contributing to fatty liver development in overfed Shitou geese.
