	<h1>CeRNA Network Construction in Magang Goose Skeletal Muscle Across Developmental Stage</h1>
    
    <p>
		 Skeletal muscle is a crucial component of the meat industry, directly influencing meat quality and yield, and holds significant economic value. Its growth and development are regulated by intricate molecular mechanisms. This study employed transcriptome analysis to provide a detailed characterization of the expression profiles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in goose skeletal muscle at different developmental stages, and constructed a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory network. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the growth and development of goose skeletal muscle but also offer potential molecular markers and regulatory targets for improving meat quality and increasing farming efficiency, which are of considerable importance in agricultural biotechnology and livestock production practices. 	</p>

    <h1>Myofiber Maturation Stages </h1>
	
	<h2>Histological characteristics of Magang geese skeletal muscle </h2>
	</p>
	
		HE staining results show that muscle fibers at the P3 stage are complete but loosely arranged, with a high number of nuclei in cross-section. By the M3 stage, muscle fibers become denser, nuclei move to the periphery, and nuclear density decreases. The diameter of the M3 group's muscle fibers is 3.6 times that of the P3 group, and the area is 13 times larger. Additionally, the density of muscle fibers significantly decreases with age.

    <h2>Identification and potential function analysis of DEMs </h2>
		</p>
	
		This study identified 19,866 mRNA candidates, mostly 1,000-3,500 bp long. Over 65% of mRNA ORFs in Magang geese's gastrocnemius muscle were under 500 bp. mRNA expression in 3-month-old geese was lower than in the P3 group. A total of 1,949 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEMs) were found, with 1,015 downregulated and 934 upregulated. GO analysis showed enrichment in microtubule processes, complement activation, and fatty acid metabolism. KEGG analysis revealed enrichment in cell growth, proliferation, metabolism, and extracellular matrix signaling pathways, with a significant enrichment in the MAPK signaling pathway. These pathways are crucial for skeletal muscle maturation.

    <h2>Identification and analysis of DEMIs associated with skeletal muscle maturation </h2>
        </p>
	
      
		In small RNA sequencing, 78.35% were miRNAs, 18.03% mRNAs, and 3.60% other small RNAs. A total of 854 miRNAs were identified, with the most common being 22 bp long. We found 21 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMIs), with 9 upregulated and 12 downregulated. These DEMIs were highly reproducible and targeted 100 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEMs) in a network analysis. GO analysis showed enrichment in terms related to cytoskeletal anchoring, smooth muscle development, and cell division, suggesting DEMIs' role in muscle maturation. KEGG analysis revealed involvement of the MAPK, ABC transporter, PPAR, and fatty acid biosynthesis pathways in muscle maturation, highlighting their roles in cell proliferation, growth, energy balance, and lipid metabolism.

	<h2>Identification and analysis of DELs associated with skeletal muscle maturation </h2>
		</p>
	

		This study identified 10,291 lncRNAs from six samples, mostly over 1500 bp long. 66.83% were single-exon, and 22.22% had two exons. The largest category of lncRNAs was intronic, totaling 4,120. We found 172 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs), with 77 down-regulated and 97 up-regulated. DELs may regulate adjacent genes in a cis-fashion, and GO and KEGG analyses on these genes suggested involvement in the MAPK signaling pathway, tight junction, smooth muscle contraction, and cellular response to epinephrine. These findings hint at DELs' role in muscle development and maturation through key cellular processes and pathways. A network of 21 miRNAs and 102 lncRNAs was also constructed.

    <h2>Construction of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network </h2>
	</p>
	A lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network for leg skeletal muscle maturation was constructed based on predicted target relationships and the ceRNA theory. The network includes 102 lncRNAs, 21 miRNAs, and 100 mRNAs. Analysis showed a power-law distribution of node degrees with a slope of -1.5 and an R2 value of 0.9842, suggesting scale-free network properties. MiRNAs displayed higher centrality and degree centrality compared to lncRNAs and mRNAs, highlighting their pivotal roles in the network.

		Intersection analysis of signaling pathways from DEMs, DELs, and DEMIs enrichment revealed that the MAPK signaling pathway was co-enriched, suggesting its critical role in Magang goose skeletal muscle maturation. The MAPK pathway regulates muscle growth and size by balancing protein synthesis and degradation. A schematic diagram of the MAPK pathway network related to muscle maturation was constructed based on regulatory relationships among these molecules.

    <h1>Myogenesis stage</h1>
	
   <h2>Histological characteristics of Magang geese skeletal muscle </h2>
	</p>
	
		There are significant differences in the morphology of muscle fibers in Magang goose leg muscles at two developmental stages. At 20 days of embryonic age, muscle fibers are not fully formed, with indistinct contours and nuclei still centrally located within myoblasts. By 3 days of age, the cross-section of Magang goose leg muscle fibers shows a complete structure, clear gaps between muscle bundles, and nuclei gradually moving towards the cell periphery as muscle fibers develop.

    <h2>Identification and potential function analysis of DEMs </h2>
		</p>
	
		The study identified 2,289 mRNAs with differential expression, consisting of 1,318 downregulated and 971 upregulated mRNAs, with good replicate consistency shown in heat maps. GO analysis highlighted terms linked to energy production, collagen formation, and cell signaling. KEGG analysis showed enrichment in 59 pathways, including those involved in cell cycle, FoxO, MAPK, P53, calcium signaling, insulin signaling, and actin cytoskeleton regulation, all crucial for muscle development and growth. Metabolic and energy-related pathways like PPAR signaling and fatty acid metabolism were also enriched, along with ECM interactions and focal adhesion pathways.

A network of these miRNAs with 89 target genes was constructed, revealing potential roles in cell processes. Notably, gga-miR-30c-5p is implicated in cell proliferation and apoptosis, while others are linked to pathways like MAPK and calcium signaling, indicating their importance in cellular functions.
