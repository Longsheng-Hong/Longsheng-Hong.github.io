	<h1>Protective Effects of PAMK on LPS-Induced Liver Injury in Gooselings: Transcriptome and Cellular Studies</h1>
    
    <p>
         Bacterial diseases pose a significant challenge in the poultry industry. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) released by the death and disintegration of Gram-negative bacteria can enter the liver through the bloodstream or the portal vein, causing not only liver damage in poultry but also reduced production performance and even death. Polysaccharide of Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz (PAMK), the main active ingredient in Atractylodes macrocephala, has various pharmacological effects including immune function regulation, liver protection, antioxidation, growth promotion, gastrointestinal function regulation, and anti-tumor activity.
          <p>
	  This study utilized goslings as a model to establish a liver injury model induced by LPS and to investigate the protective effects of Polysaccharide of PAMK against LPS-induced liver damage. In vivo experiments assessed the impact of PAMK on LPS-induced liver inflammation and necrosis through pathological observation, oxidative stress detection, and transcriptome analysis, with a focus on the MLKL pathway. In vitro experiments were divided into PAMK treatment, MLKL inhibition, and MLKL overexpression groups to explore the mechanisms by which PAMK alleviates liver cell injury. Employing techniques such as cell isolation, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, EDU, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting, the study revealed that PAMK effectively mitigated LPS-induced liver injury and oxidative stress in goslings by inhibiting the MLKL/Caspase 1/IL-1β pathway.

    <h2>Histopathological Observation and Oxidative Stress Index Detection </h2>
	</p>
	
      Liver HE staining showed that PAMK can significantly improve liver damage in goslings caused by LPS, including the arrangement of hepatic cords, dilation of sinusoids, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Biochemical indicators detected that PAMK can reduce the increased levels of AST, ALT, and MDA caused by LPS, while increasing the activity of SOD and CAT, indicating that PAMK can alleviate liver oxidative stress caused by LPS.

    <h2>DEG Identification and Analysis </h2>
        </p>
	
      In the comparison between the control group and the LPS group, 728 DEGs were identified, with 425 genes upregulated and 303 genes downregulated in the LPS group. In the comparison between the LPS group and the PAMK+LPS group, 408 DEGs were found, with 242 genes upregulated and 166 genes downregulated in the PAMK+LPS group. The intersection of DEGs from both comparisons resulted in 108 DEGs.

        <p>

	The intersection analysis revealed that the DEGs from the three groups were commonly enriched in 9 key signaling pathways. Based on previous research and analysis, the MLKL/Caspase 1/IL-1β pathway was selected as the focus of the study.

	By comparing with the control group’s receptor intensity, it was found that in the retinal bipolar cells, the ON pathway is upregulated in the pre-myopic stage and downregulated in the myopic stage. Conversely, the OFF pathway shows the opposite trend. My hypothesis is that the ON pathway inhibits the onset of myopia, while the OFF pathway promotes the development of myopia.

	Comparisons were made of the affected pathways within the phototransduction pathway across different regions, revealing that the central region of the retina is the area most impacted during the development of myopia.

        Comparisons were made of the changes in the ON and OFF pathways across different regions, and it was found that the alterations occurring in the central region of the retina were the most pronounced.
