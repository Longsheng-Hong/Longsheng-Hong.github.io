	<h1>Establishment of RPA-LFD visual detection method for animal influenza A virus</h1>
    
    <p>
		The study aimed to establish a recombinant polymerase amplification-lateral flow dipstick (RPA-LFD) detection method for animal influenza A virus (IAV). The method utilized primers and probes designed based on the conserved sequence of the matrix protein (M) gene of IAV. The researchers optimized the reaction conditions, specificity, and sensitivity of the RPA-LFD method. The experimental results demonstrated that the RPA-LFD method specifically detected animal IAV without cross-reactivity with other viruses such as Newcastle disease virus, duck Tembusu virus, duck hepatitis virus, and gosling plague virus. This indicates a high level of specificity for the detection method. The method also showed a short reaction time and high sensitivity, as it was able to detect a plasmid standard with a minimum concentration of 10 copies/μL within 20 minutes at 35℃.To validate the method, 50 samples of duck pharyngeal swabs collected from a live poultry market were tested. The RPA-LFD method correctly identified 3 positive samples and the remaining samples as negative, which was consistent with the results obtained from PCR and virus isolation methods. This indicates the high accuracy of the established method. In conclusion, this study successfully established a visual RPA-LFD detection method for animal IAV. The method does not require any specialized instruments or equipment, making it easy to operate and rapid in detection. It has the potential to be used for rapid clinical detection and epidemiological research in basic laboratories. 	</p>

	</p>
	        Results:Consistent findings between RPA-VF and qPCR.
	</p>
	        2 samples were detected as N-GPV positive and 6 samples were detected as GPV positive using both methods.Simultaneous detection was performed using qPCR and RPA-VF. 
	</p>


	<h2>Datasets</h2>
	<p>
		This study recruited six shuttlecock elite college athletes and six college Amateur students who have never been in shuttlecock sports, a total of twelve volunteers, and divided them into two groups according to their skill level, namely the Elite group and the Amateur group.
		After introducing a simple shuttlecock action to the Amateur group, put an WSD on the outside of the right ankle uniformly, and specify the serve range and effective landing range
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			After analyzing and filtering the data, a total of 2481 sets of valid action data samples were obtained, of which the number of instep serving samples was 1188, and the number of inside kicking samples was 1,293. The corresponding numbers of each action and sample are shown in table below
		</li>
	</ul>
